## How to Submit Your Code

To submit your solution, you will need to fork this repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request to the `development` branch. Follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repository's page on GitHub.
- This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Forked Repository
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of this repository.

### 3. Create a New Branch
Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd <repository-name>
```
Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name, such as `candidate-solution`:
```bash
git checkout -b candidate-solution
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Complete the task as described in the assessment instructions.

If you have already completed the task, you can drag and drop your files into the repository.

Add your files and commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a commit message"
```

### 5. Push Your Changes to GitHub
Push your branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin candidate-solution
```

### 6. Submit a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

Click the **Contribute** button and then **Open Pull Request**.

In the pull request creation page:
- Set the base repository to `Molars-Dental-Practice/Technical_Assessment_ML`.
- Set the base branch to `development`.
- Set the head repository to your forked repository (e.g., `<your-username>/<repository-name>`).
- Set the compare branch to your branch (e.g., `candidate-solution`).

Add a title and description for your pull request.

Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Important Notes
- Ensure your pull request targets the `development` branch, not the `main` branch.
- Do not modify any files outside of the scope of the assessment unless instructed.
- If you need to update your pull request after submitting it, simply push new changes to the same branch, and the pull request will update automatically.
